## Movement towards meta-science.

* Replication crisis in Psychology

--

* Describing the samples we use. 

--

--> Recurrent criticism that psychology relies on student samples (e.g., [Thalmayer et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1037/amp0000622))

--

--> [W.E.I.R.D.](https://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/pdfs/WeirdPeople.pdf) : Western Educated Industrialised Rich and Democratic

--

--> External validity - [measurement crisis](https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245920952393)

--

--> ['Power failure'](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn3475)

Previous project on samples used in [Evolution and Human Behaviour and Evolutionary Psychology](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40806-019-00192-2).

???
70% Online or student samples / >80% from 'Western' countries (Europe, USA/CAN/AUS)

## Sampling

A closer look at the samples being used.

--

Descriptive project

--

* Are samples different from general population in terms of age?

* Are samples different from general population in terms of BMI?

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/3orieOSgDeu3pHrFIY/giphy.gif") 
```

???
Why focus on age and BMI. Interesting variables: Aging population / population becoming more obese.
Separate gen. pop. and students.

---
## Methodology.

* All papers from 2021 from _Body Image_ (n = 137).

* 149 samples (5 meta-analyses or content analyses not analysed further).

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Body_image.jpg") # See Elsevier web page
```

---
## Methodology: Coding

* Type of paper (Quant. or not)

--

* Type of design (Between, Mixed, Within)

--


* Country (incl. multi-country)

--


* Type of sample: "General Population", Student, Other

--

* Sample characteristics (Age, Majority Ethnicity, Gender)

--

* BMI (Mean/SD - how measured)

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

```

???
Sample type based on majority

---
## Methodology: Statistical power

* [Cohen (1988)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&as_epq=Statistical%20power%20for%20the%20social%20sciences&as_occt=title&as_sauthors=J+Cohen&as_ylo=1988&as_yhi=1988&as_sdt=1.&as_sdtp=on&as_sdtf=&as_sdts=22&): 'small', 'medium' and 'large' effect sizes: 0.2 , 0.5 and 0.8 for Cohen's _d_. 

--

* [Lovakov & Agadullina (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2752): over 6,000 Cohen's _d_ estimates and based on the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile, they suggested 0.15, 0.36 and 0.65 as small, medium and large.

--

* Some very broad assumptions: 

  * _t_-test (between-subject)
  * two-tailed _p_. 
  * 80% power is "good".

```

---
## Methodology: Simulations

* **Age**. Estimates from [CIA world factbook](cia.gov/the-world-factbook/) from 2020.

--

* **BMI**. Overall population estimate by gender from [NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC)](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673617321293) from 2016. Further checks with matched age groups.

--
* 100k simulations. One simulation: Draw a random sample (_n_) of the same size as the original study's sample size. $n \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\,\sigma^{2})$ using the Means and SD provided. We then perform a one sample _t_-test against the reference value. 

--

* median _p_ value of those 100k simulations.

---
## Power: Between-subject

* Median sample size: n = 404 (n = 393, if we restrict the analysis to one sample per paper).

--

* Excellent statistical power for both theoretical and empirical 'large' effect sizes: 100% and >99.99%, respectively. 

--

* Very good power to detect 'medium' theoretical and empirical effect sizes: 99.89% and 95.04%, respectively. 

--

* Low power to detect 'weak' effect sizes: 51.81% and 32.44%.

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

```


???
Robustness checks needed.

---
## Power: mixed designs

* Median sample size was substantially lower for designs classified as mixed (n = 142) versus between-participant (n = 404). 

--

* Excellent statistical power for both theoretical and empirical 'large' effect sizes: 99.72% and 97.04%, respectively. 

--

* Good power to detect 'medium' theoretical effect size of 0.5 : 84.10%, but inadequate power to document an empirical medium effect 56.76%. 

--

* Very low power to detect 'weak' effect sizes: 21.96% and 14.40%.

```


---
## Gender

* **Across all samples**: No difference in the median sample sizes of men and women (respectively: 240 and 249, Wilcoxon test _p_ = .821). 

--

* **General population samples**: Sample sizes did not differ by gender (Wilcoxon test _p_ = .658). 

--

* **Student samples**: female sample sizes tended to be larger than male sample sizes (respective medians: 199.5 vs. 70.5, Wilcoxon test _p_ = .007).

--

* Samples that collected **both** men and women (n = 60): Significantly more women than men (median difference: 16.5 more women than men, paired Wilcoxon test, _p_ = .002). 

--

* Similar conclusion when we restrict to general population samples or student samples (respective _p's_ = .002 and .012).

## Age

knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/IfmBUejvpdodjsGydA/giphy-downsized-large.gif")
```

--

* Weighted mean age by sample size for women (_M_ = 26.83 years, _SD_ = 6.17) was significantly lower than that for men (_M_ = 30.83, _SD_ = 8.70, _t_(52552) = 73.19, _d_ = 0.554). 

--

* The overall difference between men and women in age is largely driven by that there are more women in student samples.

```

???
Notice discrepancy in n men for students vs. n women

---
## BMI

* BMI collected for `r round((100/144)*100, 2)`% of the quantitative samples. Vast majority of samples BMI was self-reported. `r round((9/100)*100, 2)`% reporting it being measured. 

--

* **All Samples**: The weighted mean BMI by sample size for women (_M_ = 24.41, _SD_ = 5.27) was significantly lower than that for men (_M_ = 26.27, _SD_ = 5.95, _t_(62452) = 46.73, _p_ < .0001, _d_ = 0.312).

--

* **General population**: The weighted mean BMI by sample size for women (_M_ = 25.36, _SD_ = 5.98) was significantly lower than that for men (_M_ = 25.51, _SD_ = 5.45, _t_(36686) = 2.84, _p_ = .005, _d_ = 0.026).

--

* **Students**: The weighted mean BMI by sample size for women (_M_ = 22.8, _SD_ = 4.13) was significantly lower than that for men (_M_ = 25.13, _SD_ = 5.03, _t_(2056) = 18.17, _p_ <.0001, _d_ = 0.548). (Note over 10x as large a difference)

???
Note again that female students outnumber male students 10 to 1.

## Summary

* Provided an overview of the type of samples that are in _Body image_ .

--

* Simulations suggest that "general population" samples tend to differ from the overall population in age and sometimes also BMI.

--

* Simulations suggest that student samples tend to differ from age matched population samples in BMI.

Limitations: descriptive project. Did not code claims on inference or generality. Though some examples call for further research on other cultures or ethnicities.

---
## Moving forward... 

* **Description.** Whether it is "Good or Bad" is a different question -- I am not an editor for _Body Image_ (not even an active researcher on body image.)

--

* Our synthesis might provide some reference data for future work.

--

* Introduction of [Constraints on Generality statements](https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691617708630).
